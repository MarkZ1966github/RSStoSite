This is how SwarmSports grabbed RSS feeds and dropped them to a MySQL database

When SwarmSports was built, there was no code found that could accomplish what this did. Basically taking the RSS feed URL,
and storing it in a MySQL database. 

The code is obviously needing a total overhaul, as there is no way I'd put the db_user, db_pw right in the code. Duh! But it does work, and still does work to this day - you can see it over here at http://swarmsports.com
